## 🤓️ Your task is to create counter component.

### 📢️ IMPORTANT: Read all the following lines before you start coding.

### ⛔️ DO NOT write your code in this file. This is just a read me file.

See the `result.png` picture to see what the final result should look like.

- **TODO 1:** Get familiar with the `useState` hook from React. Read more https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html \

- **TODO 2:** Now that you know what the `useState` hook does, create a variable called `value`, with its equivalent setter `setValue`. \

- **TODO 3:** Create an increment `button` in the `Counter.tsx` component. The button must increment the `value` you just created in step 1.
  **hint:** Take a look at this for more info https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html

- **TODO 4:** Create an decrement `button` the same way you created the increment button.
