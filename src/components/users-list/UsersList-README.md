# WELCOME TO DEMO #4: Filter a list of users

## 🤓️ Your task is to filter a list of users in the UI.

### 📢️ IMPORTANT: Read all the following lines before you start coding.

### ⛔️ DO NOT write your code in this file. This is just a read me file.

See the `result.gif` picture to see what the final result should look like.

- **TODO 1:** Get familiar with the `useState` hook from React. Read more https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html \

- **TODO 2:** Now that you know what the `useState` hook does, create a variable called `searchValue`, with its equivalent setter `setSearchValue`. \
  **hint 1**: Import `useState` from `react`
  **hint 2**: `const [searchValue, setSearchValue] = useState('');`

- **TODO 3:** Create an `input` in the `UsersList.tsx` component. The input must use the value of the variables you just created in step 1. Make sure your input works before you go to the next step \
  **hint:** Take a look at this for more info https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55757761/handle-an-input-with-react-hooks

- **TODO 4:** Make use of the value of your `input` (`searchValue`), to filter the list of users you are showing \
  **hint:** You have to modify the `renderAllUsers` function.

- **TODO 5:** Modify the `renderAllUsers` functions so that it does not only show the filtered users, but also the total match (amount of users found) \
  **hint:** Functions and component must ALWAYS return a block. In this case, you may want to wrap the return of `renderAllUsers` inside a `div` element.
