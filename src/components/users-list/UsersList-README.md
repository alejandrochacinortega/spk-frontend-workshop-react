# WELCOME TO DEMO #5: Show several lists of users

## 🤓️ Your task is to show a list of users in the UI.

### 📢️ IMPORTANT: Read all the following lines before you start coding.

### ⛔️ DO NOT write your code in this file. This is just a read me file.

See the `result.png` picture to see what the final result should look like.

- **TODO 1:** Fix the function `renderAllUsers` in the `UsersList.tsx` component. Instead of returning `I should return all users :(`, do something so that the function returns all the names of the `users` \
   **hint:** You just did this in demo 3 😉️

- **TODO 2:** In the same `UsersList.tsx` component, create a function that returns ONLY the name of those people with brown eyes. Call that function inside what the component is returning that you can see it in the UI \
  **hint:** You can use the filter function you learn last week 😉️ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter

- **TODO 3:** In the same `UsersList.tsx` component, create a function that returns ONLY the name of those people older than 39. Call that function inside what the component is returning that you can see it in the UI \

- **TODO 5:** In the same `UsersList.tsx` component, create a function that returns how many people have "strawberry" as their favorite fruit.
