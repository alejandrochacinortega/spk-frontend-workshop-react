# WELCOME TO DEMO #1: Add your first React component

## 🤓️ Your task is to create a component called `HelloWorld` that will be shown in the App.

### 📢️ IMPORTANT: Read all the following lines before you start coding.

### ⛔️ DO NOT write your code in this file. This is just a read me file.

Welcome to your first component. When you write in React, you write components. A component is a file that has a format `.tsx`.

See the `result.png` picture to see what the final result should look like.

- **TODO 1:** Create a new file called `HelloWorld.tsx`. The new file must be created under `hellow-world` folder. \
  **hint:** Use `Welcome.tsx` as a guide##

- **TODO 1.1:** The HelloWorld component should return a `<div>` element.

- **TODO 1.2:** Inside the div element, create an h1 element and add the following text "Hello World in React".

- **TODO 1.3:** Inside the div element, create an h2 element and add the following text "My name is YOUR_NAME and I am ready to learn this awesome framework."

- **TODO: 2:** Now that you have created your component, you just need to export it. \
  **hint:** See Line 16 in `Welcome.tsx` for more details.

- **TODO 3:** Add your new component in `App.tsx`. \
  **hint:** See Line 9 in App.tsx to see how we use the `<Welcome />` component `<Welcome />`
